# QuarantineClock

Welcome to Quarantine Clock

Quarantine Clock is a Raspberry Pi that displays the day of the week and an approx time of day. The screen backlight is linked to a Hue Motion Sensor (via the "phue" python library) so that it turns on for 5 minutes at a time then turns off when there is no motion. The clock is a webpage in Chromium in kiosk mode and uses Javascript to get the day and hour.

For setting up phue, visit: https://github.com/studioimaginaire/phue

Add the following to "/etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart"
